// This PostCSS configuration file sets up Tailwind CSS and Autoprefixer.
// It is used to process CSS files in the frontend of the application.
// Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development.
// Autoprefixer adds vendor prefixes to CSS rules using values from Can I Use.
// This configuration is typically used in a React application to style components with Tailwind CSS.
// The `plugins` object specifies the plugins to be used by PostCSS.
// In this case, it includes `tailwindcss` for Tailwind CSS support and `autoprefixer` for adding vendor prefixes.
// The `tailwindcss` plugin processes the CSS files to generate utility classes based on the Tailwind CSS configuration.
// The `autoprefixer` plugin ensures that the generated CSS is compatible with a wide range of browsers by adding necessary vendor prefixes.
//  // This configuration file is typically placed in the root of the frontend project directory.
//  // It is used by build tools like Webpack or Vite to process CSS files
//  // during the build process, ensuring that the final CSS output is optimized for production.
//  // The file is usually named `postcss.config.js` and is automatically detected by
//  // PostCSS when processing CSS files.
